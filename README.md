# LatrobeAIProject
A back-propagation neural network implementation that I wrote for my Minor Project at Latrobe University. It allows the user to specify the number of neural nodes in each layer and how many layers are needed. I based it off of what I read in the Neural Networks chapter of Michael Negnevitsky's book, AI: A guide to Intelligent Systems. It takes numerical inputs and produces a numerical output. However, I am sure it could be adapted to do many other things, as numbers are used in pretty much everything. It is written entirely in Java and all included class files are my own code.
